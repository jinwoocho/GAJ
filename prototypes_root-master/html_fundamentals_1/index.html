<!--What I will do with learningfuze educations-->
<p>I am willing to get a job with the learningfuze educations. After getting a job, there are two choices I can make.
    First choice is that I am going to take night time classes in college while having a job. If I am able to transfer to university, I might have to
    quit the job to complete my degree. Another choice is that I will develop my programming skills by myself without going back to college.</p>
